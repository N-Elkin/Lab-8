                                    On Oahu there are many amazing places to eat from Oceanside restaraunts to local
                                    food stands on the side of the road. One of the most iconic and delicious places to
                                    eat on the island is Giovanni's Shrimp truck. Serving shrimp since 1993, this truck
                                    was the first of its kind to travel the North shore to sell plate lunches of
                                    delicious shrimp packed with flavor.

                                    The Mermaid Caves are one of Oahu’s best kept secrets (partly because locals usually
                                    won’t tell tourists how to find them). Located on Nanakuli Beack park and hidden
                                    below a hollowed out lava rock is an underwater grotto with turquoise blue waters
                                    that reflect off the walls. However beware, despite their beauty the mermaid caves
                                    can be very dangerous if you drop down there when its not low tide.

                                    Oahu, being one of the famous Hawaiian islands known for their beaches is home to
                                    many beautiful places to swim, snorkel, and dive. Sharks Cove has been rated by
                                    Scuba Diving Magazine as one of the “Top Twelve Shore Dives in the World”. Located
                                    on Oahu’s world famous North Shore, this small rocky bay forms part of Pupukea Beach
                                    Park and boasts blue water and an impressive amount of sea life. The bottom is made
                                    up of large smooth boulders and coral heads forming small caves and ledges for
                                    marine life to hide. The walls of the surrounding cliffs provide calmer water
                                    attracting schooling surface fish.
